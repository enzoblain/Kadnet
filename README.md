## 📄 License Philosophy

Kadnet is licensed under the **Server Side Public License (SSPL) v1**.

This license is intentionally chosen to protect the integrity of the Nebula ecosystem.  
While the project is fully open for **contribution, improvement, and transparency**,  
SSPL prevents third parties from creating competing platforms, proprietary versions,  
or commercial services derived from the project.

Nebula is designed to grow as **one unified, community-driven network**.  
By using SSPL, we ensure that:

- all improvements remain open and benefit the ecosystem,  
- the network does not fragment into multiple incompatible forks,  
- companies cannot exploit the project without contributing back,  
- contributors retain full access to the entire codebase.


In short, SSPL ensures that Kadnet — and the Nebula ecosystem built on top of it —  
remains **open to the community, but protected from fragmentation and exploitation**.
