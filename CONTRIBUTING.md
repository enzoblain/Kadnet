# Contributing to Kadnet

Thank you for considering contributing to **Kadnet**!  
We welcome all kinds of contributions: bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, examples, or code enhancements.

## 🛠 Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**  
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

cd kadnet
```

## 📝 Code Guidelines

- **Rust best practices**: Follow idiomatic Rust patterns.
- **Safety first**: Avoid `unsafe` unless strictly necessary and documented.
- **Async & parallel code**: Use `async/await` for network operations, and `spawn_blocking` or thread pools for CPU-bound work.
- **Tests**: Every new feature or bug fix should include tests.
- **Error handling**: Do not use `unwrap()` or `expect()` in public APIs. Prefer `Result<T, E>` or `Option<T>` and propagate errors properly.
- **Documentation**: Public APIs should have doc comments with examples (`///`), and update examples if relevant.

```

Run clippy linter for code style warnings:

```
